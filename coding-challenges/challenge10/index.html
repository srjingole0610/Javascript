          Let's say you're building a time tracking application for freelancers.
          At some point in building this app, you need a function that receives
          daily work hours for a certain week, and returns:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Total hours worked</li>
          <li>Average daily hours</li>
          <li>The day with the most hours worked</li>
          <li>Number of days worked</li>
          <li>Whether the week was full-time (worked 35 hours or more)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="test-data">
        <h3>Test Data:</h3>
        <p>[7.5, 8, 6.5, 0, 8.5, 4, 0]</p>
      </div>

      <div class="problem-solving">
        <h3>Problem-Solving Approach:</h3>
        <ul class="task-list">
          <li>Understand the problem thoroughly</li>
          <li>Break it down into sub-problems</li>
          <li>Write clean and efficient code</li>
          <li>Test with both provided data sets</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <button id="show-solution-btn" class="btn-modern">
