      <div class="challenge-description">
        <p><strong>Coding Challenge #1</strong></p>
        <p>
          We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends
          âš½)! Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game
          ('game' variable on next page). In this challenge we're gonna work
          with that data.
        </p>
        <p>Your tasks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and
            'players2')
          </li>
          <li>
            The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the
            others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one
            variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array
            ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players
          </li>
          <li>
            Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams
            (22 players)
          </li>
          <li>
            During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players.
            So create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original
            team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd
            (called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
          </li>
          <li>
            Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of
            player names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console,
            along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of
            player names passed in)
          </li>
          <li>
            The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the
            console which team is more likely to win, without using an if/else
            statement or the ternary operator.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="test-data">
        <h3>Test Data (for task 6):</h3>
        <p>
          Use players: 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'.<br />
          Then, call the function again with players from game.scored.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="problem-solving">
        <h3>Problem-Solving Approach:</h3>
        <ul class="task-list">
